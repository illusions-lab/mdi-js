**Prerequisites:** [Getting Started](/guides/getting-started/) and [Document IR](/core/document-ir/).

## Install and parse first

```bash
npm install @illusions-lab/mdi
```

The package runs the MDI parser in prebuilt WebAssembly. It works in Node.js and bundlers with WASM support; it does not need a native build on the consumer machine. Parse before an export UI makes a warning visible instead of silently rendering through it:

```ts
import { parse, renderHtmlWithDiagnostics } from "@illusions-lab/mdi";

const source = "# 第一章\n{東京|とうきょう}は雨だった。";
const parsed = parse(source);
if (parsed.diagnostics.some((item) => item.severity === "error")) {
  // Use item.code and its UTF-8 byte span to mark the editor.
}

const html = renderHtmlWithDiagnostics(source, { bodyOnly: true });
console.log(html.output);    // semantic contents of <body>
console.log(html.headings);  // source-order heading text, depth, and spans
```

`parse()` returns Rust-owned `document`, `diagnostics`, and UTF-8-byte source spans. At present the only implemented diagnostic code is `mdi.version.unsupported`; malformed inline notation normally uses its literal fallback rather than throwing. `prepareRender(source)` is the same parse-first convenience for a host workflow. The `*WithDiagnostics` helpers return that parser result alongside output; they do not make an invalid document fail automatically.

`renderHtml(source)` returns a standalone document with the MDI stylesheet. Pass `{ bodyOnly: true }` when the application owns the outer page. `renderHtmlWithDiagnostics` also exposes headings, so navigation and chapter controls need not scrape generated HTML. The stable MDI classes (`mdi-ruby`, `mdi-tcy`, `mdi-em`, `mdi-pagebreak`, and related classes) are part of that semantic HTML.

## Choose the export level

The one-argument EPUB and DOCX calls are synchronous Rust baseline exports:

```ts
import { renderEpub, renderDocx } from "@illusions-lab/mdi";
import { writeFile } from "node:fs/promises";

await writeFile("book.epub", renderEpub(source));
await writeFile("book.docx", renderDocx(source));
```

Use the two-argument overloads (or their explicit `WithProfile` names) for a publication export. They are asynchronous because `@illusions-lab/mdi` converts the already-parsed Rust IR to the publication adapters; it does **not** parse MDI source again in JavaScript.

```ts
import { renderEpub, renderDocx } from "@illusions-lab/mdi";

const epub = await renderEpub(source, {
  title: "雨の東京",
  author: "Illusions",
  language: "ja",
  publisher: "Illusions Lab",
  identifier: "urn:isbn:example",
  date: "2026-07-21",
  verticalWriting: true,
  fontFamily: "Yu Mincho",
  textIndent: 1,
  chapterSplitLevel: "h1",
  coverImage: coverBytes,
  coverMediaType: "image/png",
});

const docx = await renderDocx(source, {
  title: "雨の東京",
  author: "Illusions",
  verticalWriting: true,
  fontFamily: "Yu Mincho",
  fontSize: 11,
  lineSpacing: 1.6,
  textIndent: 1,
  pagination: { gridMode: "typographic" },
  pageSize: "A5",
  landscape: false,
  margins: { top: 18, right: 15, bottom: 18, left: 15 },
  showPageNumbers: true,
  pageNumberPosition: "bottom-center",
  pageNumberFormat: "simple",
});
```

Both configured calls also accept the full nested `ExportProfile` schema through `profile` (EPUB) or directly (DOCX). The short fields above are aliases: EPUB supports metadata, writing direction, typeface, indent, chapter split, and a PNG/JPEG `Uint8Array` cover; DOCX supports metadata, direction, page size/orientation/margins, typeface/size/line spacing/indent, and page numbering (`simple`, `dash`, or `fraction`). See [Export profiles](/ecosystem/export-profiles/) for the complete JSON shape.

The default publication profile is A4, 40 characters × 30 lines, with 20 mm top/bottom and 18 mm left/right margins. Its `pagination.gridMode` is `"strict"`: the adapters derive the body size and line height from the printable area and reject `fontSize` or `lineSpacing`, rather than silently changing the requested grid. Set `gridMode: "typographic"` when an explicit point size or line-spacing matters more than the grid. This is a sizing contract, not a promise that every real-world page (headings, explicit breaks, reader layout, and fonts can intervene) contains exactly 40×30 glyph slots.

## What remains the semantic owner

Rust owns parsing, diagnostics, source spans, and the semantic MDI-to-HTML/baseline-export decisions. Publication settings belong to the adapter layer: EPUB/DOCX profile settings shape an archive, while paper geometry, Chromium behavior, and application UI preferences belong to the host. The configured DOCX exporter represents page breaks, vertical text, ordinary paragraph formatting, ruby/tate-chu-yoko/no-break/kern/blank constructs as far as OOXML permits, but it is not a byte-for-byte visual equivalent of browser HTML. Test the generated DOCX in the target Word-compatible reader when those Japanese composition details are critical.

## HTML and PDF hosts

PDF is deliberately in the Node-only entry point, so browser bundles do not acquire a browser launcher:

```ts
import { preparePdfExport, renderPdfWithChromium } from "@illusions-lab/mdi/node";

// Electron can take this HTML and call its own print-to-PDF API.
const request = preparePdfExport(source, profile);

// Node uses @illusions-lab/mdi-to-pdf when it is installed.
const pdf = await renderPdfWithChromium(source, profile);
```

Install `@illusions-lab/mdi-to-pdf` alongside `@illusions-lab/mdi` for the default Node/Playwright adapter. An Electron host may instead pass `{ renderHtmlToPdf(html, profile, sourceWritingMode) }` to `renderPdfWithChromium`. PDF profiles cover paper, landscape, margins, writing direction, font, font size/line spacing, character/line grids, indentation, and page-number settings. Browser/WASM consumers can use the baseline renderer APIs from the main entry point, but configured publication adapters and PDF are Node/Electron host workflows; send `preparePdfExport()` to a capable host.

## Other exports and errors

`renderText`, `renderTextFormat`, and `serializeMdi` are synchronous Rust functions. `renderTextFormat` accepts `txt`, `txt-ruby`, `narou`, `kakuyomu`, or `aozora` plus an optional indentation prefix. `parseMdiSyntax` is a deprecated alias for `parse`; `MDI_SPEC_VERSION` is `"2.0"` and `MDI_IR_VERSION` is `"1.0"`.

Non-string source is a `TypeError`; invalid option objects are also rejected with `TypeError`. Treat diagnostics as document feedback, and reserve `try`/`catch` for programming, I/O, archive, or host-renderer failures. Source spans are UTF-8 **byte** offsets, not JavaScript string indices; see [Diagnostics](/core/diagnostics/).
